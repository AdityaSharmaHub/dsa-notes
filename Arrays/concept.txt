Array

A data structure that contains any kind of data type but all of the elements should have the same data type.
Like if a array is created to store integers than all the elements in it must be an integer and nothing else.

max length of array - 10 raise to 6 (inside int main) and 10 raise to 7 (if declared globally)


Rotate an array logic -

If you want to rotate an array by D elements than store the 3 elements in a separate array and then shift the elements by one position and atlast append the created array into the main array.

It simply says I keep on adding the elements while iterating and when the sum becomes -ve I'd not take that element, skip that element and move on to the next element. 

It is used to find the maximum subarray
