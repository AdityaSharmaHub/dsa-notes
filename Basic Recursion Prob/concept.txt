What is a Recursion ?
When a function calls itself until a specified condition is met

Example - Infinite Recursion

void printAllNos(int n) {
    cout << n << endl;
    printAllNos(n+1);
}

int main()
{
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;

    printAllNos(n);
    return 0;
}

RESULT - Goes into Infinite loop and gives segmentation fault/stack overflow

SOLUTION - You will have to mention the base condition (when the process should be stop)
