N = 7789

extraction of digits

N = 7789 % 10 = 9 --> gives the last digit
N = 7789 / 10 = 778 --> if u want the N except the last digit

so,
N = 7789 % 10 = 9                                                       
/ 10 
N = 778 % 10 = 8
/10 
N = 77 % 10 = 7
/10 
N = 7 % 10 = 7
/10 
N = 0 % 10 = 0 --> as soon as we get zero we can say that we have extracted all the digits present.
